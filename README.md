# Overview
Simple project to explore synthesizing wind instruments mathematically. This is mostly using Fourier synthesis techniques and experimenting with various functions to drive the envelope of "formants" around each harmonic. So far comes very close but theres always a level of dynamism missing between the synthetic vs organic samples.
